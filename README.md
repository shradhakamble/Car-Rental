# RideOnWay

You are part of a team, building a ride management application like Uber. You are responsible for the
driver onboarding module. As part of this module you are required to build an interface that will allow a
driver to sign-up as a driver partner. The driver onboarding module should:
a) Allow a driver to sign-up and enter their profile information
b) Trigger onboarding processes like document collection, background verification, shipping of
tracking device, etc.,
c) Allow a driver to mark when they are ready to take a ride
Please create a list of the API interfaces you will expose to support these requirements and also come up
with choices of data stores, tech stacks, etc.,
